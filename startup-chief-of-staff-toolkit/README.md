# Startup Chief of Staff Toolkit

This repository contains a small set of templates and playbooks I would use in a Chief of Staff / Executive Operations role.

The focus is on:
- Turning complex topics into clear, actionable communication
- Aligning senior stakeholders quickly
- Creating lightweight structure in fast-moving environments

The repo is intentionally simple: it's not about code, but about how to create leverage for a CEO and leadership team.
