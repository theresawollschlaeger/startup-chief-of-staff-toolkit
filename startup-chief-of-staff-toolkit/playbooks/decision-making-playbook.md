# Decision-Making Playbook for Leadership Teams

Goal: Faster, clearer decisions with fewer meetings and less confusion.

---

## 1. Classify the decision

- **Type 1:** Irreversible or very hard to reverse → CEO / Leadership decision  
- **Type 2:** Reversible → delegate as low as possible

For each topic, explicitly label the type before discussion.

---

## 2. Prepare the decision

Before the meeting, the owner sends an executive briefing (see template):

- One-line summary
- Decision needed
- Options
- Recommendation

No briefing → no decision.

---

## 3. Meeting hygiene

- One owner per decision  
- One clear recommendation  
- Max 15 minutes per decision  
- Document the decision and responsible owner

---

## 4. After the decision

- Communicate the decision in writing to affected teams  
- Log it in a simple "decision log" (date, owner, context, rationale)  
- Review major decisions quarterly: did they age well?

This reduces re-litigation and helps the organisation learn.
