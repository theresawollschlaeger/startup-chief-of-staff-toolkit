# Stakeholder Management Guide

A simple approach to keep senior stakeholders aligned without drowning in meetings.

---

## 1. Map stakeholders

For any major initiative:

- Who can block this?
- Who needs to actively support it?
- Who will be strongly affected?

Assign each as:
- **Sponsor** (actively drives)
- **Contributor** (provides input / work)
- **Informed** (needs updates, not decisions)

---

## 2. Communication rhythm

Define a rhythm:

- Weekly: short written update (status, key risks, next steps)
- Bi-weekly or monthly: live check-in with sponsors
- Ad-hoc: escalation if risks materialise

---

## 3. Align on success

For each key stakeholder, clarify:

- What does “success” look like for you?  
- What are your red lines?  
- How will we know this is working?

Capture this in one shared document.

## 4. Handle conflict

When stakeholders disagree:

- Go back to shared goals  
- Visualise trade-offs  
- Offer 2–3 clear options with pros/cons  
- Ask for a decision from the right level (often the sponsor or CEO)
